## Initial concept

My initial idea was to develop a website that would serve as a place for people who want to start their day with a positive mindset, take a break from work or studies, or simply enjoy a moment of laughter. My mission was to provide a daily dose of joy and wisdom to our users, making their online experience more uplifting and enjoyable.

The target audience includes anyone looking for daily motivation, a quick break from studies, someone in need of a smile or a dose of positivity, or anyone wanting a break from social media.

The journey began with the idea of sharing daily quotes, but I didn't stop there. To inject even more joy into our users' day, I introduced a collection of lighthearted jokes as the project unfolded. This expansion was inspired by invaluable input from my mentor, Harry, who suggested the delightful toggle button that allows you to switch between quotes and jokes.

### Key Objectives:

- Provide a daily source of inspiration and humor.
- Create a user-friendly and visually appealing platform.
- Cultivate a sense of positivity and well-being.
- Attract and engage users seeking motivation.

#### Unique Selling Proposition (USP):

Our content is carefully selected to provide genuine value and bring joy to our users' lives.

#### Features and Functionality:

- More than 300 quotes and jokes that will be randomly showed to user.
- Easy navigation between quotes and jokes.
- User-friendly design for seamless browsing.
- Option to save favorite quotes and jokes.  (future feature)
- Share content on social media. (future feature)

3) Buttons: Two buttons ("A Daily Dose of Joyful Wisdom" and "A Daily Dose of Fun") allow users to switch between displaying quotes and jokes, they work when you click on them. I built it using HTML, CSS for the styles and JavaScript for function.

## Debugging and Unfixed issues

During the development of BlissfulBytes, I encountered various challenges and identified a few issues that I was able to resolve. Here's a summary of the debugging:

1)Inconsistent Image Display: One of the issues I had was that the background images were not displaying as intended. The issue was fixed by removing "../" from "let backgroundImagesQuotes" and "let backgroundImagesJokes".

2)Toggle button functionality. Initially, when users clicked on the toggle button to switch between displaying quotes and jokes, the expected behavior was not observed. Instead, clicking on the "A Daily Dose of Joyful Wisdom" (quotes) or "A Daily Dose of Fun" (jokes) buttons would automatically switch to the other content type, leading to unintended behavior.

Resolution:

To address this issue and ensure the toggle button functions as intended, several modifications were made to the codebase:

Correction of toggleQuotesAndJokes() Function:

The toggleQuotesAndJokes() function, responsible for toggling between quotes and jokes, was carefully reviewed.
The logic within this function was revised to accurately identify and switch between the two content types based on the current user selection.
This correction ensured that the toggle button now functions seamlessly, allowing users to switch between quotes and jokes as intended.
Adjustments to newQuote() and newJoke() Functions:

The newQuote() and newJoke() functions, which are triggered when users select either "A Daily Dose of Joyful Wisdom" or "A Daily Dose of Fun" buttons, were also refined.
These functions were adjusted to correctly display the chosen content type and update the user interface accordingly.
